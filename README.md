This is a react app, which contains a table of records, user could add/edit/delete the records. The data is from a hard coded file mock-data.json.
Tested and fixed the browser warning about the unique key. 
User could edit/delete exiting records or add a new record each time. However it doesn't write back to mock-data.json file.
